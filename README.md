# GreenR Visual Plant Necrosis Analysis
(Disease detection in plant images. Weekend hackathon event at Columbus Ohio.)

## Interface
The code in this repository uses MATLAB. It is part of a hackathon event project, held in Columbus, Ohio. This project was one of the 5 finalist out of 40 teams.
The key idea was to provide a convenient mobile phone based tool for novice and expert farmers to quickly acquire information about a plant
based on a picture they have taken from their mobile phone camera.
